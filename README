* You need Maven 3. `brew update; brew install maven`.

* You need to prepare the repo before you can use it:
  * strings.xml doesn't exist. Modify strings.xml.in.
  * AndroidManifest.xml doesn't exist. Modify the file fragments in manifests/.
  * The same goes for other files that are produced by preprocess.sh.
  * If you want to alter a value _to affect our build only_, put it in AndroidManifest.xml.in.
  * Use preprocess.sh to build the real files to keep Eclipse happy. The output is ignored by Git, and the Fennec merge script skips them, too.

* To merge to mozilla-central:

  ./fennec-merge-jar.sh ~/moz/hg/mozilla-central
