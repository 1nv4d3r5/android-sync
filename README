* You need Maven 3. `brew update; brew install maven`.

* You need to prepare the repo before you can use it:
  * strings.xml doesn't exist. Modify strings.xml.in.
  * AndroidManifest.xml doesn't exist. Modify the file fragments in manifests/.
  * If you want to alter a value _to affect our build only_, put it in AndroidManifest.xml.in.
  * Use build-strings.sh and build-manifest.sh to build the real files to keep Eclipse happy.

* To merge to mozilla-central:

  ./fennec-merge-jar.sh ~/moz/hg/mozilla-central
